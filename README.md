Taihen (working name) is a Fan project porting much of the functionality of Yomichan to a OSX application following the same conventions and colors with a few liberties taken here and there.

### Getting Started:

Guide to Taihen:
[Getting Started With Taihen](Docs/GettingStarted.md)

### Project Description:

This project is not very mature with bugs, known issues and some intentional differences such as verb conjugation using a learning algorithm and which dictionary libraries are used under the hood. I hope to eventually add machine learning to improve the user experience and create the best Japanese reader app.
