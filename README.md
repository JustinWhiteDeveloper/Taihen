Taihen (working name) is a Fan project porting much of the functionality of Yomichan to a OSX application following the same conventions and colors with a few liberties taken here and there.

This project is not very mature with bugs, known issues and some intentional differences such as verb conjugation using a learning algorithm and which dictionary libraries are used under the hood. I hope to eventually add machine learning to improve the user experience and create the best Japanese reader app.

Can open txt files to read in the reader.

At a later stage, open to porting to other languages with the right help.
