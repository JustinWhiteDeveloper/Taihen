# Taihen

![Tests](https://github.com/JustinWhiteDeveloper/Taihen/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

Taihen (working name) is a Fan project porting much of the functionality of Yomichan to a OSX application following the same conventions and colors with a few liberties taken here and there.

While the visual differences are somewhat obvious there are a few non-visual differences such as how verb conjugation works and dictionaries used under the hood. I hope to eventually add machine learning to improve the user experience and create the best Japanese reader app.

Open to porting to other languages with the right help.
